        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>SaveOurOceans is a website that calls for action towards pollution and littering in oceans caused by a regular person during their daily tasks. This problem is causing the planet’s lifespan to decrease. This is because the ocean is the planet’s temperature control, wildlife home, and so much more that contributes to our overall living conditions and the planet’s system.</p>
        <p>Our reasoning is that when you think of pollution in the ocean it is from industrial causes and larger companies although a large percentage of pollution rates are from people’s daily activities.</p>

      <h4>Why is this problem harmful?</h4>
      <p>
        Pollution in the ocean is harmful because it damages marine life, destroys ecosystems, and makes the water unsafe for future generations. As plastic, chemicals, and waste build up, fish and other sea creatures die or get sick, which can lead to food shortages. The ocean also helps regulate the climate, so pollution can worsen climate change, making the planet hotter and weather more extreme. Future generations will have to deal with the long-term impacts on food, health, and the environment.
